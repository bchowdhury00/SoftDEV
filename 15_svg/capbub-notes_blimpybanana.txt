Example 1:
  Predictions:
    - an alert will pop up of the word clicked
  Observations:
    - Performed as expected

Example 2:
  Predictions:
    - only the table eventlistener will work and it will show an alert with the html tags etc inside of it.
  Observations:
    - 3 separate alerts come up each time
    - first is the tds, then trs, then entire table
    - HTML tags are included as suspected
  Questions:
    - How is the order of alerts determined? Is it by size or by order of creation?
    ^- Answer: Innermost element gets the first alert

Example 3:
  Predictions:
    - Without the commented line, it'll perform exactly the same as the previous one
    - When uncommented, it may stop the other event listeners from firing.
  Observations:
    - As predicted, the other event listeners do not fire and only the table alert is displayed
    - stopPropagation makes it so that only the largest element fires.

Example 4:
  Predictions:
    - We predict that the order in which eventlisteners are attached will not matter
  Observations:
    - We were correct. The largest element gets precedence in stopPropagation and smallest gets precedence when all of them fire at the same time.
